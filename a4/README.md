Within the movies.csv file, one of the areas that needs attention is that of the "Gross", which I assume means the total amount of money the movie made. There are other minor issues, such as missing data in the ratings, one line, and stars columns, but not as glaring as the gross column.

In order to remedy this, I simply wrote a line that cuts everything except for line 9, aka the "Gross" column", into a new file.
